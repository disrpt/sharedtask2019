## Introduction

The RST Basque Treebank was annotated at subsentential level following Tofilosky et al. (2009) and using the extended classification of discourse relations following the Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) by Mann and Thompson (1988). The annotated corpus contains 60 abstract texts from three different domains: medical, terminologycal and scientific. RSTTool (O'Donnel 2000), an annotation interface for RST was used to annotate this corpus and RhetDataBase was used to annotate the signals of the rhetorical relations.
