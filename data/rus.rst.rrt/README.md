## Introduction

Russian RST Treebank 1.0 is a first version of a Russian corpus with annotations for Discourse Structure, annotated manually with discourse relations. This treebank was annotated manually with discourse structure in the Rhetorical Structure Theory  framework (RST, Mann & Thompson 1988) using the rstWeb [https://corpling.uis.georgetown.edu/rstweb/info/]. 

Russian RST Treebank 1.0 it consists of 79 news articles and 99 research articles (in field of computer science and on linguistics).

This study was funded by RFBR according to the research project ¹ 17-29-07033.

## DISRPT 2019 shared task information

Since the Russian RST Treebank does not contain gold tokenization and sentence splitting, data was automatically tokenized and parsed using UDPipe. As a result sentence splits in conll files are not always correct. Additionally, some of the scientific texts contain portions in other languages, such as bibliographical references in English, brief summaries or keywords not in Russian.

### Notes on segmentation

Note that some regions of text in the Russian RST Treebank are not internally segmented despite containing multiple sentences, such as bibliographies.
