## Description

NLDT is a corpus of 80 Dutch texts from expository and persuasive genres, which we annotated for rhetorical and genre-specific discourse structure, and lexical cohesion with the goal of creating a gold standard for further research. The annotations are based on a segmentation of the text in elementary discourse units that takes into account cues from syntax and punctuation. 

## DISRPT 2019 shared task information

For the DISRPT 2019 shared task on elementary discourse unit segmentation, train/dev/test partitions were balanced for genre. Syntactic parses in UD were provided by the original team, with the modification that empty/ellipsis nodes (with decimal point IDs such as 10.1) were eliminated in order to match the format of other corpora in the shared task.
